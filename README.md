# fpga_memtest
An attempt to make use of the sram available on Olimex boards ice40hx8k/1k

This whole ordeal started when making some adaption for the ZX81 and Jupiter
Ace old-timer computer models available for the blackice fpga boards.

I did a port and some alterfications to the Olimex ice40 boards.

These boards have a nice external 512 kB SRAM handy, I thought, for memory
expansions.

One thing with these SRAMs is that they function in very much the same
way as old-fashioned RAMs, such as the 2114 (1kx4), 6116 (2kx8) an 6264 (8kx8) just to mention a few.

The moderna counterparts are nearly identical except much faster and with more
capacity.
